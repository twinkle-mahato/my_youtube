Debouncing:

typing slow = 200ms 
typing fast = 30ms

Perfomance:

- iphone pro max = 14 letter * 1000 = 140000
- with debouncing= 3 API calls * 1000 = 3000


Debouncing with 200ms

- if difference between 2 key strokes is less than 200ms [<200ms] - DECLINE API call
- if difference between 2 key strokes is greater then 200ms [>200ms] - make an API call
